Congratulations to the Bgee team at SIB for producing this monumental release!

From the [Bgee blog](https://bgeedb.wordpress.com/2014/12/19/rolling-out-bgee-13-from-5-to-17-species-with-gene-expression-calls/):

> In the 2 years since our last release, we have transferred all our
annotations to the bilaterian ontology Uberon (see [this
paper](http://www.jbiomedsem.com/content/5/1/21) for the ontology
work) and made many other back-end changes which will make Bgee more
powerful and better equipped to deal with the increasing diversity of
species with RNA-seq data.

> As a result of these changes, we can now provide expression calls for
17 species, up from 5 species in the previous release. The new species
include model organisms such as C. elegans and chicken, as well as a
diversity of tetrapods. For each species, we have developed a
developmental ontology ( [ontologies on Google Code](http://developmental-stage-ontologies.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/src) ;
[developmental stage modeling collaboration on Github](https://github.com/obophenotype/uberon/wiki/Modeling-developmental-stages) ).
[As before](http://bgee.unil.ch/bgee/bgee?page=documentation#expressionCalls),
Present/Absent expression calls are a consensus of information from in
situ hybridizations, microarrays, RNA-seq and ESTs, depending on the
data available for each species.
