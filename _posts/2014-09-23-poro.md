Our paper on the Poriferan Ontology (PORO) has been
[published in JBMS](http://www.jbiomedsem.com/content/5/1/39).

## Why a separate ontology?

We made the decision to create a distinct federated ontology for
sponges in part because there is so little overlap between sponge
anatomy and the rest of Uberon. Uberon represents many bilaterian
classes such as [organ](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_0000062)
, [mesoderm](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_0000926) ,
[brain](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_0000955) , [nervous
system](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_0001016) , [compound
organ](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_0003103) and so on, but
these are not found in sponges.

Managing the ontology as a separate unit makes it easier for the
domain experts to make changes as required. At the same time, the
ontology is federated, and ultra-generic uberon classes are used where
appropriate. Future versions of the composite and collected versions
of Uberon will include PORO as modular units.

## Cardinality

One modeling difference from Uberon is the frequent use of OWL cardinality constraints. E.g.

    'triaxone’ EquivalentTo 
     spicule and (has_component exactly 3 ‘ray axis’) and (has_component exactly 6 ‘ray’)

This necessitates the use of a DL reasoner like HermiT for managing PORO.
