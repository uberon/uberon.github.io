## Versioning

All Uberon artefacts are versioned, with each versioned artefact
having its own distinct PURL.

All versioned PURLs have the URL prefix: [http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/uberon/releases/](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/uberon/releases/)

This is followed by the version ID which is always a date in ISO-8601 format, followed by the artefact name

For example, the 2019-11-22 release of the main uberon.owl file can be found at:

[http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/uberon/releases/2019-11-22/uberon.owl](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/uberon/releases/2019-11-22/uberon.owl)

All 2019-11-22 releases can be found at:

 * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/uberon/releases/2019-11-22/

Never hardcode the URL the versioned PURL resolves to. Always use the official PURL.
